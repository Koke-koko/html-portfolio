<h3>Atelier Rorona</h3>
<p>This is where everything sitarted for me, my love to the saga and this games</p>

<h3>Atelier Totori</h3>
<p>It has a few misses, but it compensates it with a really interesting and good story</p>

<p>Takes what Atelier Rorona and Totori did good and merges it into this new game</p>

<p>Loved this one, props to Ayesha for leaning everything by herself</p>
